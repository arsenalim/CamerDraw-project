This is a program for drawing on the screen in real time. You can start an online conference, turn on a screen demonstration and illustrate your thoughts, but at the same time you will be visible to all participants of the conference.

You can only draw with one hand!!!

How to draw:
-Move your hand across the screen and lines will appear behind your index finger
-The width and color of the line can be adjusted in the program file
-If you want to let go of the brush, straighten your middle finger. The program will ignore your hand if your middle and index fingers are straight, and the rest are bent
-When you clench your hand into a fist, the screen clears
-Try to keep your fingers upright, so the program will work correctly
